There were two parts that took most of my efforts. The first, and being the 
largest was the deployment to heroku. First, I had no indication why I was 
getting HTTP error 500. Then, after tyring many different things, I searched 
and found a logs page on heroku. Fixing the database name formating in 
database.php took a while; file path changes, the adding the 'USE' function to 
all queries. Further, it would call syntax errors on previously working 
functions. I built this app using XAMPP prior to deployment on Heroku. I have
had to alter nearly every file for this work.
